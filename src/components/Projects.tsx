      description: "I built an AI-driven sentiment trading system that ingests market headlines and social chatter, scores sentiment, and turns it into buy/sell signals with risk controls (position sizing, stops, cooldowns). It executes in a paper-trading account, logs every trade, and supports backtesting. I also shipped a responsive React dashboard that streams the bot's live portfolio—holdings, P&L, equity curve, and trade history—so you can monitor performance in real time.",
